OBJECTIVE
I want to be challenged. Programming is fun when it's challenging and involves deep thought. I’m looking for a role where my time is spent analyzing a difficult problem to understand it, decomposing it into a coherent logical structure, and writing algorithms to optimally solve it. Some of my career has had me do this and some of it has been too shallow to keep me interested. I do not want an easy role where the primary job is basic data pushing, i.e., accepting input, applying simple business logic, and database storage. My ideal career path has me writing more machine learning algorithms and working closely with super smart machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data scientist experts. My wife and I are moving soon and I will consider joining a team in California, Washington, or Colorado.
